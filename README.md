# Car-Sales-Data-Analysis-with-Python

## ***The Data***
The data consists of car sales between 01-01-2022 and 30-12-2023 across the US (synthethic data: 23906 rows (1 row = 1 sale) and 16 columns ).

## ***The Goal***

The goal of this project is to leverage Market and Seasonal Analysis to derive useful information from sales data.
This information will be obtained by identifying key cyclical trends and market drivers, in order to optimize the Supply Chains and Inventory management.
This in turn will ensure that dealer stock levels align with anticipated customer demand, minimizing costly overstocking while preventing lost sales due to stockouts, ultimately maximizing profitability and operational efficiency.

## ***The Tools***

Jupyter Notebook

Python Libraries used (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

AI assisted in some complex visualizations

## ***The Structure***
### **1 - Importing, Data Overview and Data Cleaning**
  
### **2 - Data Analysis:**

What are the relevant factors affecting sales, what are the trends telling us and how can we optimize sales/supply chains and inventories, based on consumer preferences and market trends?

**Seasonal**

How are Sales Trends evolving and are there any seasonal patterns to get insights from?

How is the car sales activity during the different days of the week?

**--Regional--**

Which Regions are selling the most and how are the trends evolving?

**--Engine--**

Which Engine Type sells more and should we be shifting production to satisfy consumer preferences?

**--Transmission--**

Which Transmission Type sells more and should we be shifting production to satisfy consumer preferences?

**--Body Style--**

What do Body Style trends tell us? Should we be shifting production to satisfy consumer preferences? Does Gender play a role on it?

**--Gender--**

What are car sales trends per gender telling us? Should we prepare our models to cater to a specific gender preference?

**--Color--**

What are car sales color trends telling us? Should we increase the supply of certain colors?

**--Price Category--**

How are different car price levels sales evolving? Should we adapt our pricing strategy?

**--Income Group--**

How is each Income Group trend sales evolving? What are their preferences for Body Style, so we can adapt our supply according to the groups we want to target?
